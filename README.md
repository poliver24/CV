'Nothing in this life worth achieving is easy, nor is it impossible' - James May. 

Having completed a BSC in Combined Engineering and landing a position as Safety Engineer in Comau (a leading robotics company) I found myself wanting more out of my role. With a passion for problem solving and desire to develop my algorithmic thinking it was inevitable that my interest would peak when the software team was integrated to the engineer department.

Intrigued and constantly curious about software development I researched the subject and finally took the risk to leave my role and join Makers, a software development bootcamp.

As a self starter, innovative thinker and overall great guy to talk to especially when coffee (and cake) is involved; I feel content with my decision to pursue a skill that will lead me into a career I can fully immerse myself in and use my progressive skillset to its potential.

It didn't come easy, but that's why it's worth it.
