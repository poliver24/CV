***'Nothing in this life worth achieving is easy, nor is it impossible' - James May***

Having completed a BSC in Combined Engineering and landing a position as Safety Engineer in Comau (a leading robotics company) I found myself wanting more out of my role. With a passion for problem solving and desire to develop my algorithmic thinking it was inevitable that my interest would peak when the software team was integrated to the engineering department.

Intrigued and constantly curious about software development I researched the subject and finally took the leap, leaving my role to join Makers Academy, a software development bootcamp.

As a self starter, innovative thinker and overall great guy to talk to especially when coffee (and cake) is involved; I feel content with my decision to pursue a skill that will lead me into a career I can fully immerse myself in and use my progressive skillset to its potential.

It didn't come easy, but that's why it's worth it.

## SKILLS

**Analytical Thinker** - Effective problem solving is a essential part of being a Safety Engineer. Each time I am presented with a complex problem, I will take the time to break it down and to really understand its intricacies. From doing this it is possible to create SMART goals that I can use to estimate the time it will take to complete, and to measure my progress against. 

**Team Member** - Working in an Engineering position, I was continually surrounded by large scale problems which would often involve numerous business departments. It is essential to collaborate and work together effectively in order to find the best solution. 

**Effective Communication** - There are certain situations that really test your team working abilities and how effectively you are able to communicate, little does this quite so effectively as a national level Paintball tournament. Being able to effecitvely communicate your current situation and the location of the opposing team members through cross-field shouting, whilst under the constant barage of 15 paintballs per second is no mean feat. Mastering this ability was the corner stone to our success. 

**Self-Learner** - Often, the best way to innovate, to improve, to adapt, is to do something different. Occasionaly this means doing something totally new, that you nor your team has experience in. One time I did just this was during my University dissertation, working on an individual project I decided to let passion lead the way. Through numerous online resources and breaking the problem into more manageable chunks, I ended up effectively using technologies my tutors had never before touched, and implemented them to create a final piece I was elated with. An object tracking paintball sentry gun. Pretty cool right?!
