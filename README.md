# **PATRICK OLIVER**

**It didn't come easy, but that's why it's worth it**

Having completed a BSC in Combined Engineering and landing a position as Safety Engineer in Comau (a leading robotics company) I found myself wanting more out of my role. With a passion for problem solving and desire to develop my algorithmic thinking it was inevitable that my interest would peak when the software team was integrated to the engineering department.

Intrigued and constantly curious about software development I researched the subject and finally took the leap, leaving my role to join Makers Academy, a software development bootcamp.

As a self starter, innovative thinker and overall great guy to talk to especially when coffee (and cake) is involved; I feel content with my decision to pursue a skill that will lead me into a career I can fully immerse myself in and use my progressive skillset to its potential.

## SKILLS

**Analytical Thinking** - Effective problem solving is a essential part of being a Safety Engineer. Each time I am presented with a complex problem, I will take the time to break it down and to really understand its intricacies. After doing this, I generate solutions to the problem and validate my progress through tests. 

**Communication** - There are certain situations that really test your team working abilities and how effectively you are able to communicate, little does this quite so effectively as a national level Paintball tournament. Being able to effecitvely communicate your current situation and the location of the opposing team members through cross-field shouting, whilst under the constant barage of 15 paintballs per second is no mean feat. Mastering this ability was the corner stone to our success.

**Self-Learner** - Often, the best way to innovate, to improve, to adapt, is to do something different. Occasionaly this means doing something totally new, that you nor your team has experience in. One time I did just this was during my University dissertation, working on an individual project I decided to let passion lead the way. Through numerous online resources and breaking the problem into more manageable chunks, I ended up effectively using technologies my tutors had never before touched, and implemented them to create a final piece I was elated with. An object tracking paintball sentry gun. Pretty cool right?!
